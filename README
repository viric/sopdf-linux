-----------------------------------
original win32 version is by 'theguru' on mobileread.com

many thanks to him for releasing a very useful tool.

Required libraries
------------------
libjpeg, zlib, freetype, fontconfig, expat
all of these are probably installed by default on most distros.
in ubuntu/debian, you can do:
  sudo apt-get install libjpeg62 zlib1g libfreetype6 libfontconfig1 libexpat1
you will also want the *-dev packages if you're compiling from scratch.

Running:
========
my favorite:
./sopdf -i blahblah.pdf -m 3

for a discussion on possible conversion modes, see the forum thread.
for possible parameters:
./sopdf -h

Compiling:
==========
I just got my PRS505 today and after searching around for linux
based tools I found soPdf... well it was windows only so I 
spent a few hours fiddling with it.

there are many ways to port it, but it's almost 5am so I went for 
the easiest, dirtiest way to do it. there are no nice configure
scripts, no makefiles, etc. just a lot of typing gcc at the
prompt...

I assume some level of competence from the reader who's
attempting to do this, so I won't waste my breath on details.

I grabbed a clean un-windows'd fitz/mupdf source tree.
You can get it from the original http://ccxvii.net/fitz/,
but I'm more familiar with git than darc, so I just
cloned the repo from http://github.com/kjk/mupdf/tree/master

I diffed kjk's mupdf with sopdf's mupdf and basically found
the only major mismatch was a new bbox field in fz_node.
So I patched two files to reflect this change:
  mupdf/world/node_misc1.c
  mupdf/include/fitz/wld_tree.h

Follow the README for fitz and build it.
make sure to grab the optional packages jasper and jbig2dec
(fitz/mupdf docs will explain)
Jasper source: http://www.ece.uvic.ca/~mdadams/jasper/#download
jbig2dec: http://jbig2dec.sourceforge.net/

Once you have all the required dependencies set up, it's
time to build soPdf itself.
The soPdf.c and processPdf.c included in this archive
are simply the original soPdf.cpp and processPdf.cpp 
minus the win32 specific stuff.

Link the *whole* beast, all object files, +also need 
-lm -ljpeg `freetype-config --libs` `pkg-config fontconfig --libs`
and you'll get an executable.
